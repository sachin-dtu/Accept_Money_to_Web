# 💰 Accepting Payments with Stripe

This repository demonstrates how to integrate Stripe for accepting payments on your GitHub account. Stripe is a popular payment processing platform that allows you to securely accept credit card payments online.

## ⚙️ Setup

To set up Stripe for your GitHub account, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Stripe Account:** If you don't already have a Stripe account, sign up for one at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com). It's free and only takes a few minutes to set up.

2. **Generate Stripe API Keys:** Once you have your Stripe account, navigate to the **API Keys** section in the Dashboard. Generate both the **Publishable Key** and the **Secret Key**. Keep these keys safe and secure.

3. **Configure Environment Variables:** In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets** and add the following environment variables:
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Set this to your Stripe Publishable Key.
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Set this to your Stripe Secret Key.

4. **Clone Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`

5. **Update Configuration:** Open the `config.js` file in your cloned repository and replace the placeholder values with your own Stripe API keys.

## 🚀 Usage

To start accepting payments through Stripe, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies:** In your terminal, navigate to the repository folder and run the following command:
`npm install`

2. **Run the Application:** Once the dependencies are installed, start the application by running:
`npm start`

3. **Test Payment Flow:** Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to see the payment form. You can use Stripe's [test card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards) to simulate different payment scenarios.

4. **Customize Integration:** Feel free to customize the payment integration to fit your specific needs. The `index.html` and `server.js` files provide a starting point for building out your payment flow.
